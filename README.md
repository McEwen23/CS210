Software Development Lifecycle

1) How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?

   a) I believe one of the most useful parts about engaging with users or stakeholders is getting to put a face with the product you are trying to design. Asking         very specfiic questions is essential to understanding user needs. Designing UML class diagrams, flow charts and test cases can help implement the repsonse to       these questions in clear and effiecent manner into the program.

   b) User Stories are helpful to this process in a multitude of ways. Mainly the stories are codified using a formal process that is easy to understand. This             improves efficiency from the time of the ideas’ inception all the way to when it finally gets implemented. This makes it easier on all parties involved to           meet the overall objective. The user stories are an efficient means to get your idea heard and conveyed correctly with the least amount of documentation             possible. This enables a high performing team to perform. 

2) How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?

   a) I approach the development of a program by first reviewing the specification documentation. Once I have an idea of what im building I will then start to             create a rough draft of the program by asking myself, how am I going to design and break up the functionality so that the program is maintainable, scalable,         and readable. Additionaly, I would consider how to design my classes using a UML class diagram and build test cases to meet one of agiles just enough               functionality principle. 
   
   b) In future projects I will start to implement the different phases of a modified agile methodology by putting myself in each role. Much like starting a small         business you will most likley wear mulitple hats such as the sales team, marketing team, CEO, CFO etc. Developing small computer programs using agile should         be no different. I will start by putting myself in the product owners shoes. I will document all functionality of a program based on user specifications. I         will then track these specifications in the product back log that I will create for myself through user stories. Once this is complete I will then determine         how long a sprint cycle is going to be for the functionality I have documented. Once i've decided what sprint cycle is going to be (it could be a day or two)       I will then put my tester hat on to start bulding test cases for the functionality desired. Once complete, I will start development and repeat this irreative       process until the project is complete. I will then reflect on the project to determine what I could've done better.
   
3) What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?

   Being a good team member starts by keeping your word and holding yourself accountable. If you say you are going to do something then you should do it. This          fosters trust amongst other team members. Next, is seeking to understand and communication. Being able to inform the team of issues, asking for help, or updating    the team on what you have completed on the project thus far is crucial to team success. Lastly, I believe subortinating your ego is imperative if you want to be    a good team member. This will prevent most confilict and inspire debates that seek what is right rather than to simply prove you are "right".
